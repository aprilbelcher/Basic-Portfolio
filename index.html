				<p>Hello there! If you are reading this that means you are interested in getting to know me. I have two dogs, beefy and porky. They get along pretty well, love them very much that I bring with them wherever I can. 
				<p>Speaking of traveling, I love going to new places and learning more about other cultures. The last places I visited was Dubai, Maldives and Australia. To pass the time, I like watching movies and binge watching tv series. My current obession is Game of Thrones. I am not a picky eater, I will try any delicacies at least once. My favorite dish is kare-kare and lengua. I dont like plants as much other people but I do have favorite flower which is peony.</p>
